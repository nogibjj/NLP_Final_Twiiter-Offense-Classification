## Instructions:

### Installation and Data
The list of packages and libraries required for this project are presnt in the requirements.txt file, install these packages before running the codes in this project.

The raw data used is present in the /01_Data/01_Raw folder, this is the only external data required for this project, all other data can be generated by the files present in this project.

The codes for Data-processing is present in the 02_Codes/01_Data_Processing/02_Cleaning.ipynb file, this file cleans the data and splits the cleaned data into Test and Train set and saves them in the processed data folder as test.csv and train.csv respectively

### Naive Bayes

The Naive Bayes model implementation is present in the /02_Codes/02_Models/01_Generative_Model.ipynb file.
This file reads the train and test data which was generated ealier and implemts the Naive Bayes model.
This file is also used to generate the synthetic data for the project and the outputs are saved in the processed data folder as with "_syn" in the name.

### LSTM 

The LSTM model implementation is present in the /02_Codes/02_Models/02_Discriminative_Model.ipynb file.
This file reads the train and test datasets created ealier (both Real and Synthetic) and uses them to implement the LSTM model

### Outputs

The plots from all the codes are saved in the 03_plots folder with respective subfolders.
